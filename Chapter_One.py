##Algorithm-- Write a plan for how to make the logic to have the computer write "Hello, world!" 20 times in the console.

##What is your algorithm?

##Now, can you go ahead and make the code for this algorithm?

##Can you try running it, and debug it until it works?

##What kind(s) of errors are you encountering? Syntactic? Semantic? Runtime?

##When the computer performs your task, can you describe what happens inside, roughly? You can consult your Chapter One material to do this.

##Now make the computer say your name 1000 times. Is that difficult for you, or easy?
