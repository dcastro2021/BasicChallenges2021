#Can you do this: Crate a program, with a function. The function will test if one string is a subset of another.
#Here is the function code

    y = x * x
    return y

#Here is the root code
v = 3
z = multiply_by_three(v)
print("")
print(z)

#It will return true or false.

#In the main body ask for input.

#Use the input to test the input string against the one you chose.

#Have the program print whether it is a substring or not.
